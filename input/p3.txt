Scene 1: Two friends at a coffee shop
Friend A: Did you know I've been researching time travel lately?
Friend B: Oh, really? When are you planning on going?
Friend A: Well, I haven't decided yet, but I promise I won't be late.

Friend B: So, you're going to master the art of being on time by traveling through time?
Friend A: Exactly, I'm going to put those 'time management' seminars to shame.
